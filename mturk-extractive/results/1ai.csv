"About 10 years ago* I took on the task to teach global development to Swedish undergraduate students. That was after having spent about 20 years together with African institutions studying hunger in Africa* so I was sort of expected to know a little about the world. And I started in our medical university* Karolinska Institute* an undergraduate course called Global Health. But when you get that opportunity* you get a little nervous. I thought* these students coming to us actually have the highest grade you can get in Swedish college systems -- so* I thought* maybe they know everything I'm going to teach them about. So I did a pre-test when they came. And one of the questions from which I learned a lot was this one: ""Which country has the highest child mortality of these five pairs?""",I began teaching global development to Swedish undergrads ten years ago. I did a pre-test asking them which countries had the highest child mortality.|"About 10 years ago* I took on the task to teach global development to Swedish undergraduate students.

Not knowing where they were* I offered them a pre-test. |And I put them together* so that in each pair of country* one has twice the child mortality of the other. And this means that it's much bigger a difference than the uncertainty of the data. I won't put you at a test here* but it's Turkey* which is highest there* Poland* Russia* Pakistan and South Africa. And these were the results of the Swedish students. I did it so I got the confidence interval* which is pretty narrow* and I got happy* of course: a 1.8 right answer out of five possible. That means that there was a place for a professor of international health -- (Laughter) and for my course.,Using a narrow confidence interval* I found high child mortality rates in Turkey* Poland* Russia* pakistan* and South Africa. |And I put them together* so that in each pair of country* one has twice the child mortality of the other.

I have shown that Swedish top students know statistically significantly less about the world than the chimpanzees. (Laughter) Because the chimpanzee would score half right if I gave them two bananas with Sri Lanka and Turkey. They would be right half of the cases.,Chimps could score better than the best of Swedish students. |But one late night* when I was compiling the report I really realized my discovery.

(Laughter) And they said* ""The world is still 'we' and 'them.' And we is Western world and them is Third World."" ""And what do you mean with Western world?"" I said. ""Well* that's long life and small family* and Third World is short life and large family.""",We used a software the displayed the countries as bubbles* with the size displaying the population and the fertility rate.

I put fertility rate here: number of children per woman:one* two* three* four* up to about eight children per woman. We have very good data since 1962 -- 1960 about -- on the size of families in all countries. The error margin is narrow. Here I put life expectancy at birth* from 30 years in some countries up to about 70 years.And 1962* there was really a group of countries here that was industrialized countries* and they had small families and long lives. And these were the developing countries: they had large families and they had relatively short lives. Now what has happened since 1962? We want to see the change. Are the students right? Is it still two types of countries? Or have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here? Or have they got longer lives and live up there?,We've been studying data on the size of families in all countries since about 1960. In 1962 industrial countries had smaller families and longer lives while developing countries had larger families and shorter lives. The question is: what has changed since 1962?|So this is what I could display here.

This is all U.N. statistics that have been available. Here we go. Can you see there? It's China there* moving against better health there* improving there. All the green Latin American countries are moving towards smaller families. Your yellow ones here are the Arabic countries* and they get larger families* but they -- no* longer life* but not larger families. The Africans are the green down here. They still remain here. This is India. Indonesia's moving on pretty fast. (Laughter) And in the '80s here* you have Bangladesh still among the African countries there. But now* Bangladesh -- it's a miracle that happens in the '80s: the imams start to promote family planning. They move up into that corner. And in '90s* we have the terrible HIV epidemic that takes down the life expectancy of the African countries and all the rest of them move up into the corner* where we have long lives and small family* and we have a completely new world.(Applause),Several countries have differing trends regarding family size and life expectancy. HIV had an especially large impact in Africa. |Let's see. We stopped the world then. This is all U.N. statistics that have been available. Here we go. Can you see there?

And this is what happens: the data during the war indicate that even with all the death*there was an improvement of life expectancy. By the end of the year* the family planning started in Vietnam and they went for smaller families. And the United States up there is getting for longer life* keeping family size. And in the '80s now* they give up communist planning and they go for market economy* and it moves faster even than social life. And today* we have in Vietnam the same life expectancy and the same family size here in Vietnam* 2003* as in United States* 1974* by the end of the war. I think we all -- if we don't look in the data -- we underestimate the tremendous change in Asia* which was in social change before we saw the economical change.,Family planning started in Vietnam in 1964* and now* families are smaller and life expectancy is longer* much like is now seen in the United States.|Let me make a comparison directly between the United States of America and Vietnam.1964: America had small families and long life; Vietnam had large families and short lives.

This is the world distribution of income of people. One dollar* 10 dollars or 100 dollars per day. There's no gap between rich and poor any longer. This is a myth.There's a little hump here. But there are people all the way. And if we look where the income ends up -- the income -- this is 100 percent the world's annual income. And the richest 20 percent* they take out of that about 74 percent. And the poorest 20 percent* they take about two percent. And this shows that the concept of developing countries is extremely doubtful. We think about aid* like these people here giving aid to these people here. But in the middle* we have most the world population* and they have now 24 percent of the income.,There is no gap between the rich and the poor anymore.  Most of the world's population is found in the middle class* not the richest or poorest classes.|Let's move over to another way here in which we could display the distribution in the world of the income.

I can show you Africa. This is Africa. 10 percent the world population* most in poverty. This is OECD. The rich country. The country club of the U.N. And they are over here on this side. Quite an overlap between Africa and OECD. And this is Latin America. It has everything on this Earth* from the poorest to the richest* in Latin America.

And if I now let the world move forward* you will see that while population increase* there are hundreds of millions in Asia getting out of poverty and some others getting into poverty* and this is the pattern we have today.
