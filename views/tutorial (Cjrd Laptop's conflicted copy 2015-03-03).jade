            | On the next pane, you can either upload a text or srt transcript file of the video or use YouTube's autogenerated transcript. Notes: text transcript files must have a ".txt" suffix and srt transcript files must have a ".srt" suffix. Also, YouTube's autogenerated transcripts are typically pretty terrible, so use hand-created transcripts when possible.

            | After successfully uploading a video and transcript, you can start creating the video digest via our editing interface. The "Editing Instructions" pane in the bottom right lists the actions that you can perform. Here's an example of a few common actions:
            ul#vd-action-list
                li
                    h3 Segment the video into chapter elements
                    img.action-image(src="")
                    .action-description TODO
                li
                    h3 Segment the video into section elements
                    img.action-image(src="")
                    .action-description TODO
                li
                    h3 Segment the video into chapter elements
